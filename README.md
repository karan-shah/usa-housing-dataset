## Application of the CRISP-DM Process
The purpose of this project is to predict and analyze the USA housing sales prices. We are going to build the regression model to predict the USA house prices based on different factors.

## Domain Knowledge
In real estate industry housing price are dependent on various features like  number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, sqft, year built, year renovated, condition, location of the house.

## Data Understanding and EDA
This dataset contains data about USA housing sales and its provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains features like number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, sqft, year built, year renovated, condition, zipcode and the target variable will be price.
We will use various visualization methods to analyze the correlation of each feature as part of EDA.

## Data Preparation
We have observed that there are few columns which have ambiguous values for example some entries in year renovated,bedroom and bathroom has value as 0 so we will have to decide weather they are missing values or legitimate values.

## Machine Learning
We are planning to implement predictive regression models.

## Evaluation
We will use the different evaluation methods such as confusion matrix, R square errors and model scores to decide the predictive models.

## Conclusion
